As a number of attempts have been made to put together in order an account of those events which took place among us ,
As they were handed down to us by those who saw them from the first and were preachers of the word ,
It seemed good to me , having made observation , with great care , of the direction of events in their order , to put the facts in writing for you , most noble Theophilus ;
So that you might have certain knowledge of those things about which you were given teaching .
In the days of Herod , king of Judaea , there was a certain priest , by name Zacharias , of the order of Abijah ; and he had a wife of the family of Aaron , and her name was Elisabeth .
They were upright in the eyes of God , keeping all the rules and orders of God , and doing no wrong .
And they were without children , because Elisabeth had never given birth , and they were at that time very old .
Now it came about that in his turn he was acting as priest before God ,
And as was the way of the priests , he had to go into the Temple to see to the burning of perfumes .
And all the people were offering prayers outside , at the time of the burning of perfumes .
And he saw an angel of the Lord in his place on the right side of the altar .
And Zacharias was troubled when he saw him , and fear came on him .
But the angel said , Have no fear , Zacharias , for your prayer has come to the ears of God , and your wife Elisabeth will have a son , and his name will be John .
And you will be glad and have great delight ; and numbers of people will have joy at his birth .
For he will be great in the eyes of the Lord ; he will not take wine or strong drink ; and he will be full of the Spirit of God from his birth .
And through him great numbers of the children of Israel will be turned to the Lord their God .
And he will go before his face in the spirit and power of Elijah , turning the hearts of fathers to their children , and wrongdoers to the way of righteousness ; to make ready a people whose hearts have been turned to the Lord .
And Zacharias said to the angel , How may I be certain of this ? For I am an old man , and my wife is far on in years .
And the angel , answering , said , I am Gabriel , whose place is before God ; I have been sent to say these words to you and to give you this good news .
Now , see , you will be without voice or language till the day when these things come about , because you had not faith in my words , which will have effect at the right time .
And the people were waiting for Zacharias and were surprised because he was in the Temple for such a long time .
And when he came out he was not able to say anything , and they saw that he had seen a vision in the Temple ; and he was making signs to them without words .
And when the days of his work in the Temple were ended , he went back to his house .
After that time , Elisabeth , being certain that she was to become a mother , kept herself from men's eyes for five months , saying ,
The Lord has done this to me , for his eyes were on me , to take away my shame in the eyes of men .
Now in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God to a town in Galilee , named Nazareth ,
To a virgin who was to be married to a man named Joseph , of the family of David ; and the name of the virgin was Mary .
And the angel came in to her and said , Peace be with you , to whom special grace has been given ; the Lord is with you .
But she was greatly troubled at his words , and said to herself , What may be the purpose of these words ?
And the angel said to her , Have no fear , Mary , for you have God's approval .
And see , you will give birth to a son , and his name will be Jesus .
He will be great , and will be named the Son of the Most High : and the Lord God will give him the kingdom of David , his father :
He will have rule over the house of Jacob for ever , and of his kingdom there will be no end .
And Mary said to the angel , How may this be , because I have had no knowledge of a man ?
And the angel in answer said to her , The Holy Spirit will come on you , and the power of the Most High will come to rest on you , and so that which will come to birth will be named holy , Son of God .
Even now Elisabeth , who is of your family , is to be a mother , though she is old : and this is the sixth month with her who was without children .
For there is nothing which God is not able to do .
And Mary said : I am the servant of the Lord ; may it be to me as you say . And the angel went away .
Then Mary got up and went quickly into the high lands , to a town of Judah ;
And went into the house of Zacharias and took Elisabeth in her arms .
And when the voice of Mary came to the ears of Elisabeth , the baby made a sudden move inside her ; then Elisabeth was full of the Holy Spirit ,
And she said with a loud voice : May blessing be on you among women , and a blessing on the child of your body .
How is it that the mother of my Lord comes to me ?
For , truly , when the sound of your voice came to my ears , the baby in my body made a sudden move for joy .
Happy will she be who had faith that the things which the Lord has said to her will be done .
And Mary said : My soul gives glory to God ;
My spirit is glad in God my Saviour .
For he has had pity on his servant , though she is poor and lowly placed : and from this hour will all generations give witness to the blessing which has come to me .
For he who is strong has done great things for me ; and holy is his name .
His mercy is for all generations in whom is the fear of him .
With his arm he has done acts of power ; he has put to flight those who have pride in their hearts .
He has put down kings from their seats , lifting up on high the men of low degree .
Those who had no food he made full of good things ; the men of wealth he sent away with nothing in their hands ;
His help he has given to Israel , his servant , so that he might keep in mind his mercy to Abraham and his seed for ever ,
As he gave his word to our fathers .
And Mary was with her for about three months and then went back to her house .
Now it was time for Elisabeth to give birth , and she had a son .
And it came to the ears of her neighbours and relations that the Lord had been very good to her , and they took part in her joy .
And on the eighth day they came to see to the circumcision of the child , and they would have given him the name of Zacharias , his father's name ;
But his mother made answer and said , No , his name is John .
And they said , Not one of your relations has that name .
And they made signs to his father , to say what name was to be given to him .
And he sent for writing materials and put down : His name is John ; and they were all surprised .
And straight away his mouth was open and his tongue was free and he gave praise to God .
And fear came on all those who were living round about them : and there was much talk about all these things in all the hill-country of Judaea .
And all who had word of them kept them in their minds and said , What will this child be ? For the hand of the Lord was with him .
And his father , Zacharias , was full of the Holy Spirit , and with the voice of a prophet said these words :
Praise be to the Lord , the God of Israel , for he has come to his people and made them free ,
Lifting up a horn of salvation for us in the house of his servant David ,
(As he said , by the mouth of his holy prophets , from the earliest times ,)
Salvation from those who are against us , and from the hands of those who have hate for us ;
To do acts of mercy to our fathers and to keep in mind his holy word ,
The oath which he made to Abraham , our father ,
That we , being made free from the fear of those who are against us , might give him worship ,
In righteousness and holy living before him all our days .
And you , child , will be named the prophet of the Most High : you will go before the face of the Lord , to make ready his ways ;
To give knowledge of salvation to his people , through the forgiveness of sins ,
Because of the loving mercies of our God , by which the dawn from heaven has come to us ,
To give light to those in dark places , and in the shade of death , so that our feet may be guided into the way of peace .
And the child became tall , and strong in spirit ; and he was living in the waste land till the day when he came before the eyes of Israel .
Now it came about in those days that an order went out from Caesar Augustus that there was to be a numbering of all the world .
This was the first numbering , which was made when Quirinius was ruler of Syria .
And all men went to be numbered , everyone to his town .
And Joseph went up from Galilee , out of the town of Nazareth , into Judaea , to Beth-lehem , the town of David , because he was of the house and family of David ,
To be put on the list with Mary , his future wife , who was about to become a mother .
And while they were there , the time came for her to give birth .
And she had her first son ; and folding him in linen , she put him to rest in the place where the cattle had their food , because there was no room for them in the house .
And in the same country there were keepers of sheep in the fields , watching over their flock by night .
And an angel of the Lord came to them , and the glory of the Lord was shining round about them : and fear came on them .
And the angel said , Have no fear ; for truly , I give you good news of great joy which will be for all the people :
For on this day , in the town of David , a Saviour has come to birth , who is Christ the Lord .
And this is the sign to you : you will see a young child folded in linen , in the place where the cattle have their food .
And suddenly there was with the angel a great band of spirits from heaven , giving praise to God , and saying ,
Glory to God in the highest , and on the earth peace among men with whom he is well pleased .
And when the angels had gone away from them into heaven , the keepers of the sheep said to one another , Let us go now to Beth-lehem , and see this thing which has come about , which the Lord has made clear to us .
And they came quickly , and saw Mary and Joseph , and the child in the place where the cattle had their food .
And when they saw it , they gave them an account of the things which had been said to them about the child .
And all those to whose ears it came were full of wonder at the things said by the keepers of the sheep .
But Mary kept all these words in her heart , and gave much thought to them .
Then the keepers of the sheep went back , giving glory and praise to God for all the things which had come to their ears and which they had seen , as it had been said to them .
And when , after eight days , the time came for his circumcision , he was named Jesus , the name which the angel had given to him before his birth .
And when the necessary days for making them clean by the law of Moses had come to an end , they took him to Jerusalem to give him to the Lord
(As it says in the law of the Lord , Every mother's first male child is to be holy to the Lord) ,
And to make an offering , as it is ordered in the law of the Lord , of two doves or other young birds .
And there was then in Jerusalem a man whose name was Simeon ; and he was an upright man , fearing God and waiting for the comfort of Israel : and the Holy Spirit was on him .
And he had knowledge , through the Holy Spirit , that he would not see death till he had seen the Lord's Christ .
And full of the Spirit he came into the Temple ; and when the father and mother came in with the child Jesus , to do with him what was ordered by the law ,
Then he took him in his arms and gave praise to God and said ,
Now you are letting your servant go in peace , O Lord , as you have said ;
For my eyes have seen your salvation ,
Which you have made ready before the face of all nations ;
A light of revelation to the Gentiles , and the glory of your people Israel .
And his father and mother were full of wonder at the things which were said about him .
And Simeon gave them his blessing and said to Mary , his mother , See , this child will be the cause of the downfall and the lifting up of great numbers of people in Israel , and he will be a sign against which hard words will be said ;
(And a sword will go through your heart ;) so that the secret thoughts of men may come to light .
And there was one , Anna , a woman prophet , the daughter of Phanuel , of the family of Asher (she was very old , and after seven years of married life
She had been a widow for eighty-four years) ; she was in the Temple at all times , worshipping with prayers and going without food , night and day .
And coming up at that time , she gave praise to God , talking of him to all those who were waiting for the freeing of Jerusalem .
And when they had done all the things which were ordered by the law of the Lord , they went back to Galilee , to Nazareth , the town where they were living .
And the child became tall and strong and full of wisdom , and the grace of God was on him .
And every year his father and mother went to Jerusalem at the feast of the Passover .
And when he was twelve years old , they went up , as their way was , to the feast ;
And when the days of the feast came to an end and they were going back , the boy Jesus was still in Jerusalem , but they had no knowledge of it :
And in the belief that he was with some of their number , they went a day's journey ; and after looking for him among their relations and friends ,
And seeing that he was not there , they went back to Jerusalem , to make search for him .
And after three days they came across him in the Temple , seated among the wise men , giving ear to their words and putting questions to them .
And all to whose ears it came were full of wonder at his knowledge and the answers which he gave .
And when they saw him they were surprised , and his mother said to him , Son , why have you done this to us ? see , your father and I have been looking for you with sorrow .
And he said to them , Why were you looking for me ? was it not clear to you that my right place was in my Father's house ?
And his words seemed strange to them .
And he went down with them and came to Nazareth ; and did as he was ordered : and his mother kept all these words in her heart .
And Jesus was increasing in wisdom and in years , and in grace before God and men .
Now in the fifteenth year of the rule of Tiberius Caesar , Pontius Pilate being ruler of Judaea , and Herod being king of Galilee , his brother Philip king of the country of Ituraea and Trachonitis , and Lysanias king of Abilene ,
When Annas and Caiaphas were high priests , the word of the Lord came to John , the son of Zacharias , in the waste land .
And he came into all the country round about Jordan , preaching baptism as a sign of forgiveness of sin for those whose hearts were changed .
As it says in the book of the words of Isaiah the prophet , The voice of one crying in the waste land , Make ready the way of the Lord , make his roads straight .
Every valley will be lifted up , and all the mountains and hills made low , and the twisted will be made straight , and the rough ways smooth ;
And all flesh will see the salvation of God .
So he said to the people who went out to him for baptism : You offspring of snakes , at whose word are you going in flight from the wrath to come ?
Make clear by your acts that your hearts have been changed ; and do not say to yourselves , We have Abraham for our father : for I say to you that God is able from these stones to make children of Abraham .
And even now the axe is put to the root of the trees ; and every tree which does not have good fruit will be cut down and put into the fire .
And the people put questions to him , saying , What have we to do ?
And he made answer and said to them , He who has two coats , let him give to him who has not even one ; and he who has food , let him do the same .
Then tax-farmers came to him for baptism and said to him , Master , what have we to do ?
And he said to them , Do not make an attempt to get more money than the right amount .
And men of the army put questions to him , saying , And what have we to do ? And he said to them , Do no violent acts to any man , and do not take anything without right , and let your payment be enough for you .
And while the people were waiting , and all men were questioning in their hearts about John , if he was the Christ or not ,
John made answer , saying to them all , Truly , I give you baptism with water , but one is coming who is greater than I , whose shoes I am not good enough to undo : he will give you baptism with the Holy Spirit , and with fire :
In whose hand is the instrument with which he will make clean his grain ; he will put the good grain in his store , but the waste will be burned in the fire which will never be put out .
And so comforting them with these and other words , he gave the good news to the people ;
The Jews said , The building of this Temple took forty-six years ; and you will put it up in three days !
But his words were about that holy building which was his body .
So when he had come back again from the dead , the memory of these words came back to the disciples , and they had faith in the holy Writings and in the word which Jesus had said .
Now while he was in Jerusalem at the feast of the Passover , a great number of people came to have faith in his name , after seeing the signs which he did .
But Jesus did not have faith in them , because he had knowledge of them all .
He had no need for any witness about man ; for he himself had knowledge of what was in man .
Now there was among the Pharisees a man named Nicodemus , who was one of the rulers of the Jews .
He came to Jesus by night and said to him , Rabbi , we are certain that you have come from God as a teacher , because no man would be able to do these signs which you do if God was not with him .
Jesus said to him , Truly , I say to you , Without a new birth no man is able to see the kingdom of God .
Nicodemus said to him , How is it possible for a man to be given birth when he is old ? Is he able to go into his mother's body a second time and come to birth again ?
Jesus said in answer , Truly , I say to you , If a man's birth is not from water and from the Spirit , it is not possible for him to go into the kingdom of God .
That which has birth from the flesh is flesh , and that which has birth from the Spirit is spirit .
Do not be surprised that I say to you , It is necessary for you to have a second birth .
The wind goes where its pleasure takes it , and the sound of it comes to your ears , but you are unable to say where it comes from and where it goes : so it is with everyone whose birth is from the Spirit .
And Nicodemus said to him , How is it possible for these things to be ?
And Jesus , answering , said , Are you the teacher of Israel and have no knowledge of these things ?
Truly , I say to you , We say that of which we have knowledge ; we give witness of what we have seen ; and you do not take our witness to be true .
If you have no belief when my words are about the things of earth , how will you have belief if my words are about the things of heaven ?
And no one has ever gone up to heaven but he who came down from heaven , the Son of man .
As the snake was lifted up by Moses in the waste land , even so it is necessary for the Son of man to be lifted up :
So that whoever has faith may have in him eternal life .
For God had such love for the world that he gave his only Son , so that whoever has faith in him may not come to destruction but have eternal life .
God did not send his Son into the world to be judge of the world ; he sent him so that the world might have salvation through him .
The man who has faith in him does not come up to be judged ; but he who has no faith in him has been judged even now , because he has no faith in the name of the only Son of God .
And this is the test by which men are judged : the light has come into the world and men have more love for the dark than for the light , because their acts are evil .
The light is hated by everyone whose acts are evil and he does not come to the light for fear that his acts will be seen .
But he whose life is true comes to the light , so that it may be clearly seen that his acts have been done by the help of God .
After these things Jesus and his disciples went into the land of Judaea , and there he was with them for some time , giving baptism .
Now John was then giving baptism at Aenon near Salim , because there was much water there ; and people came and were given baptism .
For at this time John had not been put into prison .
Then a question came up between John's disciples and a Jew about washing .
And they went to John and said to him , Rabbi , the man who was with you on the other side of the Jordan , the man to whom you gave witness , is now giving baptism , and everyone is going to him .
And this was John's answer : A man is unable to have anything if it is not given to him from heaven .
You yourselves give witness that I said , I am not the Christ . What I said was , I am sent before the Christ .
He who has the bride is the husband : but the husband's friend , whose place is by his side and whose ears are open to him , is full of joy because of the husband's voice : such is my joy , and it is complete .
He has to become greater while I become less .
He who comes from heaven is greater than all others : he who comes from earth is of the earth , and of the earth are his words : he who comes from heaven is over all .
He gives witness of what he has seen and of what has come to his ears ; and no man takes his witness as true .
He who so takes his witness has made clear his faith that God is true .
For he whom God has sent says God's words ; and God does not give him the Spirit by measure .
The Father has love for the Son and has put all things into his hands .
He who has faith in the Son has eternal life ; but he who has not faith in the Son will not see life ; God's wrath is resting on him .
Now when it was clear to the Lord that word had come to the ears of the Pharisees that Jesus was making more disciples than John and was giving them baptism
(Though , in fact , it was his disciples who gave baptism , not Jesus himself) ,
He went out of Judaea into Galilee again .
And it was necessary for him to go through Samaria .
So he came to a town of Samaria which was named Sychar , near to the bit of land which Jacob gave to his son Joseph :
Now Jacob's fountain was there . Jesus , being tired after his journey , was resting by the fountain . It was about the sixth hour .
A woman of Samaria came to get water , and Jesus said to her , Give me some water .
For his disciples had gone to the town to get food .
The woman of Samaria said to him , Why do you , a Jew , make a request for water to me , a woman of Samaria ? She said this because Jews have nothing to do with the people of Samaria .
In answer Jesus said , If you had knowledge of what God gives freely and who it is who says to you , Give me water , you would make your prayer to him , and he would give you living water .
The woman said to him , Sir , you have no vessel and the fountain is deep ; from where will you get the living water ?
Are you greater than our father Jacob who gave us the fountain and took the water of it himself , with his children and his cattle ?
Jesus said to her , Everyone who takes this water will be in need of it again :
But whoever takes the water I give him will never be in need of drink again ; for the water I give him will become in him a fountain of eternal life .
The woman said to him , Sir , give me this water , so that I may not be in need again of drink and will not have to come all this way for it .
Jesus said to her , Go , get your husband and come back here with him .
In answer , the woman said , I have no husband . Jesus said to her , You have said rightly , I have no husband :
You have had five husbands , and the man you have now is not your husband : that was truly said .
The woman said to him , Sir , I see that you are a prophet .
Our fathers gave worship on this mountain , but you Jews say that the right place for worship is in Jerusalem .
Jesus said to her , Woman , take my word for this ; the time is coming when you will not give worship to the Father on this mountain or in Jerusalem .
You give worship , but without knowledge of what you are worshipping : we give worship to what we have knowledge of : for salvation comes from the Jews .
But the time is coming , and is even now here , when the true worshippers will give worship to the Father in the true way of the spirit , for these are the worshippers desired by the Father .
God is Spirit : then let his worshippers give him worship in the true way of the spirit .
The woman said to him , I am certain that the Messiah , who is named Christ , is coming ; when he comes he will make all things clear to us .
Jesus said to her , I , who am talking to you , am he .
At that point the disciples came back , and they were surprised to see him talking to a woman ; but not one of them said to him , What is your purpose ? or , Why are you talking to her ?
Then the woman put down her water-pot and went into the town , and said to the people ,
Come and see a man who has been talking to me of everything I ever did ! Is it possible that this is the Christ ?
So they went out of the town and came to him .
While this was taking place , the disciples were saying to Jesus , Master , take some food .
But he said to them , I have food of which you have no knowledge .
So the disciples said one to another , Did anyone give him food ?
Jesus said , My food is to do the pleasure of him who sent me and to make his work complete .
You would say , Four months from now is the time of the grain-cutting . Take a look , I say to you , at the fields ; they are even now white for cutting .
He who does the cutting now has his reward ; he is getting together fruit for eternal life , so that he who did the planting and he who gets in the grain may have joy together .
In this the saying is a true one , One does the planting , and another gets in the grain .
I sent you to get in grain which you had no hand in planting : other men did that work , and you take the reward .
Now a number of the people of that town had faith in him because of the woman's witness : He has been talking to me of everything I ever did .
So when the people came to him they made request to him to be among them for a time , and he was there two days .
And a great number more of them came to have faith in him because of what he himself said .
And they said to the woman , Now we have faith , but not because of your story : we ourselves have given ear to his words , and we are certain that he is truly the Saviour of the world .
And after the two days he went on from there into Galilee .
For Jesus himself said that a prophet has no honour in the country of his birth .
So when he came into Galilee , the Galilaeans took him to their hearts because of the things which they had seen him do in Jerusalem at the feast--they themselves having been there at the feast .
So he came to Cana in Galilee , where he had made the water wine . And there was a certain man of high position whose son was ill at Capernaum .
When it came to his ears that Jesus had come from Judaea into Galilee , he went to him and made a request that he would come down to his son , who was near to death , and make him well .
Then Jesus said to him , You will not have faith if you do not see signs and wonders .
The man said , Sir , come down before my boy is dead .
And Jesus said , Go in peace ; your son is living . The man had faith in the word which Jesus said to him and went away .
And while he was going down , his servants came to him and said , Your boy is living .
So he put a question to them as to the hour when he became better ; and they said to him , The disease went from him yesterday at the seventh hour .
It was clear then to the father that this was the very time at which Jesus said to him , Your son is living . And he had faith in Jesus , he and all his family .
Now this is the second sign which Jesus did after he had come out of Judaea into Galilee .
After these things there was a feast of the Jews , and Jesus went up to Jerusalem .
Now in Jerusalem near the sheep-market there is a public bath which in Hebrew is named Beth-zatha . It has five doorways .
In these doorways there were a great number of people with different diseases : some unable to see , some without the power of walking , some with wasted bodies .
One man was there who had been ill for thirty-eight years .
When Jesus saw him there on the floor it was clear to him that he had been now a long time in that condition , and so he said to the man , Is it your desire to get well ?
The ill man said in answer , Sir , I have nobody to put me into the bath when the water is moving ; and while I am on the way down some other person gets in before me .
Jesus said to him , Get up , take your bed and go .
And the man became well straight away , and took up his bed and went . Now that day was the Sabbath .
So the Jews said to the man who had been made well , It is the Sabbath ; and it is against the law for you to take up your bed .
He said to them , But he who made me well , said to me , Take up your bed and go .
Then they put to him the question : Who is the man who said to you , Take it up and go ?
Now he who had been made well had no knowledge who it was , Jesus having gone away because of the number of people who were in that place .
After a time Jesus came across him in the Temple and said to him , See , you are well and strong ; do no more sin for fear a worse thing comes to you .
The man went away and said to the Jews that it was Jesus who had made him well .
And for this reason the Jews were turned against Jesus , because he was doing these things on the Sabbath .
But his answer was : My Father is still working even now , and so I am working .
For this cause the Jews had an even greater desire to put Jesus to death , because not only did he not keep the Sabbath but he said God was his Father , so making himself equal with God .
So Jesus made answer and said , Truly I say to you , The Son is not able to do anything himself ; he is able to do only what he sees the Father doing ; whatever the Father does the Son does it in the same way .
For the Father has love for the Son and lets him see everything which he does : and he will let him see greater works than these so that you may be full of wonder .
In the same way , as the Father gives life to the dead , even so the Son gives life to those to whom he is pleased to give it .
The Father is not the judge of men , but he has given all decisions into the hands of the Son ;
So that all men may give honour to the Son even as they give honour to the Father . He who gives no honour to the Son gives no honour to the Father who sent him .
Truly I say to you , The man whose ears are open to my word and who has faith in him who sent me , has eternal life ; he will not be judged , but has come from death into life .
Truly I say to you , The time is coming , it has even now come , when the voice of the Son of God will come to the ears of the dead , and those hearing it will have life .
For even as the Father has life in himself , so he has given to the Son to have life in himself .
And he has given him authority to be judge because he is the Son of man .
Do not be surprised at this : for the time is coming when his voice will come to all who are in the place of the dead ,
And they will come out ; those who have done good , into the new life ; and those who have done evil , to be judged .
Of myself I am unable to do anything : as the voice comes to me so I give a decision : and my decision is right because I have no desire to do what is pleasing to myself , but only what is pleasing to him who sent me .
If I gave witness about myself , my witness would not be true .
There is another who gives witness about me and I am certain that the witness he gives about me is true .
You sent to John and he gave true witness .
But I have no need of a man's witness : I only say these things so that you may have salvation .
He was a burning and shining light , and for a time you were ready to be happy in his light .
But the witness which I have is greater than that of John : the work which the Father has given me to do , the very work which I am now doing , is a witness that the Father has sent me .
And the Father himself who sent me has given witness about me . Not one of you has ever given ear to his voice ; his form you have not seen .
And you have not kept his word in your hearts , because you have not faith in him whom he has sent .
You make search in the holy Writings , in the belief that through them you get eternal life ; and it is those Writings which give witness about me .
And still you have no desire to come to me so that you may have life .
I do not take honour from men ;
But I have knowledge of you that you have no love for God in your hearts .
I have come in my Father's name , and your hearts are not open to me . If another comes with no other authority but himself , you will give him your approval .
How is it possible for you to have faith while you take honour one from another and have no desire for the honour which comes from the only God ?
Put out of your minds the thought that I will say things against you to the Father : the one who says things against you is Moses , on whom you put your hopes .
If you had belief in Moses you would have belief in me ; for his writings are about me .
If you have no belief in his writings , how will you have belief in my words ?
After these things Jesus went away to the other side of the sea of Galilee--that is , the sea of Tiberias .
And a great number of people went after him because they saw the signs which he did on those who were ill .
Then Jesus went up the mountain and was seated there with his disciples .
Now the Passover , a feast of the Jews , was near .
Lifting up his eyes , Jesus saw a great number of people coming to where he was , and he said to Philip , Where may we get bread for all these people ?
This he said , testing him : for he had no doubt what he himself would do .
Philip made answer , Bread to the value of two hundred pence would not be enough even to give everyone a little .
One of his disciples , Andrew , the brother of Simon Peter , said to Jesus ,
If then God gave them , when they had faith in the Lord Jesus Christ , the same as he gave to us , who was I to go against God ?
And hearing these things they said nothing more , but gave glory to God , saying , Then to the Gentiles as to us has God given a change of heart , so that they may have life .
Then those who had gone away at the time of the trouble about Stephen , went as far as Phoenicia and Cyprus , preaching to the Jews only .
But some of them , men of Cyprus and Cyrene , when they came to Antioch , gave the good news about the Lord Jesus to the Greeks .
And the power of the Lord was with them , and a great number had faith and were turned to the Lord .
And news of them came to the ears of the church at Jerusalem : and they sent Barnabas as far as Antioch :
Who , when he came and saw the grace of God , was glad ; and he made clear to them the need of keeping near the Lord with all the strength of their hearts :
For he was a good man and full of the Holy Spirit and of faith : and a great number were joined to the Lord .
Then he went on to Tarsus , looking for Saul ;
And when he had come across him , he took him to Antioch . And they were with the church there for a year , teaching the people ; and the disciples were first given the name of Christians in Antioch .
Now in those days prophets came from Jerusalem to Antioch .
And one of them , named Agabus , said publicly through the Spirit that there would be serious need of food all over the earth : which came about in the time of Claudius .
And the disciples , everyone as he was able , made a decision to send help to the brothers living in Judaea :
Which they did , sending it to the rulers of the church by the hand of Barnabas and Saul .
Now , about that time , Herod the king made cruel attacks on the Christians .
And he put James , the brother of John , to death with the sword .
And when he saw that this was pleasing to the Jews he went on to take Peter in addition . This was at the time of the feast of unleavened bread .
And having taken him , he put him in prison , with four bands of armed men to keep watch over him ; his purpose being to take him out to the people after the Passover .
So Peter was kept in prison : but the church made strong prayer to God for him .
And when Herod was about to take him out , the same night Peter was sleeping in chains between two armed men , and the watchmen were keeping watch before the door of the prison .
And a great light was seen shining in the room , and an angel of the Lord came to Peter and , touching him on his side so that he came out of his sleep , said , Get up quickly . And his chains came off his hands .
Then the angel said , Put on your shoes and get ready to go . And he did so . And he said , Put your coat round you and come with me .
And he went out after him ; and he was not certain if what was done by the angel was a fact , for it seemed to him that he was seeing a vision .
And when they had gone past the first and second watchmen they came to the iron door into the town , which came open by itself : and they went out and down one street ; and then the angel went away .
And when Peter came to his senses he said , Now , truly , I am certain that the Lord has sent his angel and taken me out of the hands of Herod , against all the hopes of the Jews .
And when he became clear about this , he went to the house of Mary , the mother of John named Mark , where a number of them had come together for prayer .
And he gave a blow on the door , and a young girl came to it , named Rhoda .
And hearing the voice of Peter , in her joy she went running , without opening the door , to say that Peter was outside .
And they said to her , You are off your head . But still she said , with decision , that it was so . And they said , It is his angel .
But Peter went on giving blows on the door : and when it was open and they saw him , they were full of wonder .
But he made a sign to them with his hand to be quiet , and gave them an account of how the Lord had taken him out of prison . And he said , Give the news to James and the brothers . And then he went away .
Now when it was day , the armed men were greatly troubled about what had become of Peter .
And Herod , when he sent for him , and he was not there , after questioning the watchmen , gave orders that they were to be put to death . Then he went down from Judaea to Caesarea for a time .
Now he was very angry with the people of Tyre and Sidon : and they came to him , all together , and having made friends with Blastus , the controller of the king's house , they made a request for peace , because their country was dependent on the king's country for its food .
And on the day which had been fixed , Herod , dressed in his robes and seated in his place , made a public statement to them .
And the people , with loud cries , said , It is the voice of a god , not of a man .
And straight away the angel of the Lord sent a disease on him , because he did not give the glory to God : and his flesh was wasted away by worms , and so he came to his end .
But the word of the Lord went on increasing .
And Barnabas and Saul came back from Jerusalem , when their work was ended , taking with them John named Mark .
Now there were at Antioch , in the church there , prophets and teachers , Barnabas , and Symeon who was named Niger , and Lucius of Cyrene , and Manaen , a relation of Herod the king , and Saul .
And while they were doing the Lord's work , and going without food , the Holy Spirit said , Let Barnabas and Saul be given to me for the special work for which they have been marked out by me .
Then , after prayer and going without food they put their hands on them , and sent them away .
So , being sent out by the Holy Spirit , they went down to Seleucia ; and from there they went by ship to Cyprus .
And at Salamis they were preaching the word of God in the Synagogues of the Jews : and John was with them , helping them .
And when they had gone through all the island to Paphos , they came across a certain wonder-worker and false prophet , a Jew whose name was Bar-Jesus ;
Who was with the ruler , Sergius Paulus , an able man . This man sent for Barnabas and Saul , desiring to have knowledge of the word of God .
But Elymas , the wonder-worker (for that is the sense of his name) , put himself against them , with the purpose of turning the ruler from the faith .
But Saul , whose other name is Paul , being full of the Holy Spirit , looking hard at him , said ,
O you , who are full of false tricks and evil ways , a son of the Evil One , hating all righteousness , will you for ever be turning people from the right ways of the Lord ?
And now , see , the hand of the Lord is on you , and you will be blind and not able to see the sun for a time . And straight away a dark mist came down on him ; and he went about looking for a guide .
Then the ruler , when he saw what was done , had faith , being full of wonder at the teaching of the Lord .
Then Paul and those who were with him went by ship from Paphos and came to Perga in Pamphylia : and there John went away from them and came back to Jerusalem .
But they , going through from Perga , came to Antioch in Pisidia ; and they went into the Synagogue on the Sabbath and were seated .
And after the reading of the law and the prophets , the rulers of the Synagogue sent to them , saying , Brothers , if you have a word of comfort for the people , say on .
And Paul , getting up and making a sign with his hand , said , Men of Israel , and you who have the fear of God , give ear .
The God of this people Israel made selection of our fathers , lifting the people up from their low condition when they were living in the land of Egypt , and with a strong arm took them out of it .
And for about forty years he put up with their ways in the waste land .
And having put to destruction seven nations in the land of Canaan , he gave them the land for their heritage for about four hundred and fifty years .
And after these things he gave them judges , till the time of Samuel the prophet .
Then at their request for a king , God gave them Saul , the son of Kish , a man of the family of Benjamin , who was their king for forty years .
And having put him on one side , he made David their king , to whom he gave witness , saying , I have taken David , the son of Jesse , a man dear to my heart , who will do all my pleasure .
From this man's seed has God given to Israel a Saviour , even Jesus , as he gave his word ;
For whose coming John made ready the way by preaching to all the people of Israel the baptism which goes with a change of heart .
And when John was completing his work , he said , What do I seem to you to be ? I am not he ; but one is coming after me , whose shoes I am not good enough to undo .
My brothers , children of the family of Abraham , and those among you who have the fear of God , to us the word of this salvation is sent .
For the men of Jerusalem and their rulers , having no knowledge of him , or of the sayings of the prophets which come to their ears every Sabbath day , gave effect to them by judging him .
And though no cause of death was seen in him , they made a request to Pilate that he might be put to death .
And when they had done all the things said in the Writings about him , they took him down from the tree , and put him in the place of the dead .
But God gave him back from the dead :
And for a number of days he was seen by those who came with him from Galilee to Jerusalem , who are now his witnesses before the people .
And we are giving you the good news of the undertaking made to the fathers ,
Which God has now put into effect for our children , by sending Jesus ; as it says in the second Psalm , You are my Son ; this day I have given you being .
And about his coming back from the dead , never again to go to destruction , he has said these words , I will give you the holy and certain mercies of David .
Because he says in another Psalm , You will not let your Holy One see destruction .
Now David , having done God's work for his generation , went to sleep , and was put with his fathers , and his body came to destruction :
But he , who was lifted up by God , did not see destruction .
And so , let it be clear to you , my brothers , that through this man forgiveness of sins is offered to you :
And through him everyone who has faith is made free from all those things , from which the law of Moses was not able to make you free .
So take care that these words of the prophets do not come true for you ;
See , you doubters , have wonder and come to your end ; for I will do a thing in your days to which you will not give belief , even if it is made clear to you .
And when they went out , they made a request that these words might be said to them again on the Sabbath after .
Now when the meeting was ended , a number of the Jews and of the God-fearing Gentiles who had become Jews , went after Paul and Barnabas : who put before them how important it was to keep on in the grace of God .
And on the Sabbath after , almost all the town came together to give hearing to the word of God .
But when the Jews saw such a great number of people , they were full of envy and said evil words against Paul's preaching .
Then Paul and Barnabas without fear said , It was necessary for the word of God to be given to you first ; but because you will have nothing to do with it , and have no desire for eternal life , it will now be offered to the Gentiles .
For so the Lord has given us orders , saying , I have given you for a light to the Gentiles so that you may be for salvation to the ends of the earth .
And the Gentiles , hearing this , were glad and gave glory to the word of God : and those marked out by God for eternal life had faith .
And the word of the Lord went through all the country .
But the Jews , working up the feelings of the God-fearing women of high position and of the chief men of the town , got an attack started against Paul and Barnabas , driving them out of those parts .
But they , shaking off the dust of that place from their feet , came to Iconium .
And the disciples were full of joy and of the Holy Spirit .
Now in Iconium they went together to the Synagogue of the Jews and gave such teaching that a great number of Jews and Greeks had faith .
But those Jews who had not the faith , made the minds of the Gentiles bitter against the brothers .
So they kept there for a long time , taking heart in the Lord , who gave witness to the word of his grace by causing signs and wonders to be done by their hands .
But there was a division among the people of the town ; some were on the side of the Jews and some on the side of the Apostles .
And when a violent attempt was made by the Gentiles and the Jews , with their rulers , to make an attack on them and have them stoned ,
Having got news of it , they went in flight to the towns of Lycaonia , Lystra , and Derbe , and the country round about :
And went on preaching the good news there .
And at Lystra there was a certain man , who from birth had been without the use of his feet , never having had the power of walking .
This man was giving ear to the preaching of Paul , who , looking at him , and seeing that he had faith to be made well ,
Said in a loud voice , Get up on your feet . And , jumping up , he went walking about .
And when the people saw what Paul had done , they said in a loud voice , in the language of Lycaonia , The gods have come down to us in the form of men .
And they gave the name of Jupiter to Barnabas , and to Paul that of Mercury , because he was the chief talker .
And the priest of the image of Jupiter , which was before the town , took oxen and flowers to the doors of the town , and was about to make an offering with the people .
But when this came to the ears of the Apostles , Paul and Barnabas , they went running out among the people , parting their clothing , and crying out ,
Good people , why are you doing these things ? We are men with the same feelings as you , and we give you the good news so that you may be turned away from these foolish things to the living God , who made the heaven and the earth and the sea and all things in them :
Who in the past let all nations go in the ways which seemed good to them .
But he was not without witness , because he did good , and gave you rain from heaven and times of fruit , making your hearts full of food and joy .
And even with these words , it was hard for them to keep the people from making an offering to them .
But some Jews came to that place from Antioch and Iconium , and got control over the people ; and after stoning Paul , they had him pulled out of the town , taking him for dead .
But when the disciples came round him , he got up and went into the town : and the day after he went away with Barnabas to Derbe .
And having made a number of disciples through the preaching of the good news in that town , they went back to Lystra and Iconium and Antioch ,
Making strong the souls of the disciples , saying to them that they were to keep the faith , and that we have to go through troubles of all sorts to come into the kingdom of God .
And when they had made selection of some to be rulers in every church , and had given themselves to prayer and kept themselves from food , they put them into the care of the Lord in whom they had faith .
And they went through Pisidia and came to Pamphylia .
And , after preaching the word in Perga , they went down to Attalia ;
And from there they went by ship to Antioch , where they had been handed over to the grace of God for the work which they had not done .
And when they came there , and had got the church together , they gave them an account of all the things which God had done through them , and how he had made open a door of faith to the Gentiles .
And they were with the disciples there for a long time .
Now certain men came down from Judaea , teaching the brothers and saying that without circumcision , after the rule of Moses , there is no salvation .
And after Paul and Barnabas had had no little argument and discussion with them , the brothers made a decision to send Paul and Barnabas and certain others of them to the Apostles and the rulers of the church at Jerusalem about this question .
So they , being sent on their way by the church , went through Phoenicia and Samaria , giving news of the salvation of the Gentiles , to the great joy of all the brothers .
And when they came to Jerusalem , they had a meeting with the church and the Apostles and the rulers , and they gave an account of all the things which God had done through them .
But some of the Pharisees , who were of the faith , got up and said , It is necessary for these to have circumcision and to keep the law of Moses .
And the Apostles and the rulers of the church came together and gave thought to the question .
And when there had been much discussion , Peter got up and said to them , My brothers , you have knowledge that some time back it was God's pleasure that by my mouth the good news might be given to the Gentiles so that they might have faith .
And God , the searcher of hearts , was a witness to them , giving them the Holy Spirit even as he did to us ;
Making no division between them and us , but making clean their hearts by faith .
Why then are you testing God , by putting on the neck of the disciples a yoke so hard that not even our fathers or we were strong enough for it ?
But we have faith that we will get salvation through the grace of the Lord Jesus in the same way as they .
And all the people were quiet while Barnabas and Paul gave an account of the signs and wonders which God had done among the Gentiles by them .
And when they had come to an end , James , answering , said , My brothers , give ear to me :
Symeon has given an account of how God was first pleased to take from among the Gentiles a people for himself .
And this is in agreement with the words of the prophets , as it is said ,
After these things I will come back , and will put up the tent of David which has been broken down , building up again its broken parts and making it complete :
So that the rest of men may make search for the Lord , and all the Gentiles on whom my name is named ,
Says the Lord , who has made these things clear from the earliest times .
For this reason my decision is , that we do not put trouble in the way of those who from among the Gentiles are turned to God ;
But that we give them orders to keep themselves from things offered to false gods , and from the evil desires of the body , and from the flesh of animals put to death in ways against the law , and from blood .
For Moses , from times long past , has his preachers in every town , reading his law in the Synagogues every Sabbath .
Then it seemed good to the Apostles and the rulers and all the church , to send men from among them to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas ; Judas , named Barsabbas , and Silas , chief men among the brothers :
And they sent a letter by them , saying , The Apostles and the older brothers , to the brothers who are of the Gentiles in Antioch and Syria and Cilicia , may joy be with you :
Because we have knowledge that some who went from us have been troubling you with their words , putting your souls in doubt ; to whom we gave no such order ;
It seemed good to us , having come to an agreement together , to send these men to you , with our well loved Barnabas and Paul ,
Men who have given up their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ .
And so we have sent Judas and Silas , who will say the same things to you themselves , by word of mouth .
For it seemed good to the Holy Spirit and to us , to put on you nothing more than these necessary things ;
To keep from things offered to false gods , and from blood , and from things put to death in ways which are against the law , and from the evil desires of the body ; if you keep yourselves from these , you will do well . May you be happy .
So they , being sent away , came down to Antioch , and having got the people together , they gave them the letter .
And after reading it , they were glad of its comfort .
And Judas and Silas , who themselves were prophets , gave teaching to the brothers and made them strong in the faith .
And when they had been there for some time , they were sent back in peace by the brothers to those who had sent them .
But Paul and Barnabas kept on in Antioch , teaching and preaching the word of God , with a number of others .
And after some days , Paul said to Barnabas , Let us go back and see the brothers in every town where we have given the word of God , and see how they are .
And Barnabas had a desire to take with them John , named Mark .
But Paul was of the opinion that it was not right to take with them one who had gone away from them in Pamphylia , and had not gone on with the work .
And there was a sharp argument between them , so that they were parted from one another , and Barnabas took Mark with him and went by ship to Cyprus ;
But Paul took Silas and went away with the blessing of the brothers .
And he went through Syria and Cilicia , making the churches stronger in the faith .
And he came to Derbe and Lystra : and there was a certain disciple there named Timothy , whose mother was one of the Jews of the faith , but his father was a Greek ;
Of whom the brothers at Lystra and Iconium had a high opinion .
Paul had a desire for him to go with him , and he gave him circumcision because of the Jews who were in those parts : for they all had knowledge that his father was a Greek .
And on their way through the towns , they gave them the rules which had been made by the Apostles and the rulers of the church at Jerusalem , so that they might keep them .
So the churches were made strong in the faith and were increased in number every day .
And after they had gone through the land of Phrygia and Galatia , the Holy Spirit did not let them take the word into Asia ;
And having come to Mysia , they made an attempt to go into Bithynia , but the Spirit of Jesus did not let them ;
And going past Mysia , they came down to Troas .
And Paul had a vision in the night ; a man of Macedonia came , requesting him , and saying , Come over into Macedonia and give us help .
And when he had seen the vision , straight away we made the decision to go into Macedonia , for it seemed certain to us that God had sent us to give the good news to them .
So , from Troas we went straight by ship to Samothrace and the day after to Neapolis ;
And from there to Philippi , which is the most important town of Macedonia and a Roman colony : and we were there for some days .
And on the Sabbath we went outside the town , by the river , where we had an idea that there would be a place of prayer ; and , being seated , we had talk with the women who had come together .
And a certain woman named Lydia , a trader in purple cloth of the town of Thyatira , and a God-fearing woman , gave ear to us : whose heart the Lord made open to give attention to the things which Paul was saying .
And when she and her family had had baptism , she made a request to us , saying , If it seems to you that I am true to the Lord , come into my house and be my guests . And she made us come .
And when we were going to the place of prayer , we came across a girl with a spirit which gave knowledge of the future , whose masters made great profit from her power .
She came after Paul and us , crying out and saying , These men are the servants of the Most High God , who are giving you news of the way of salvation .
And this she did on a number of days . But Paul was greatly troubled and , turning , said to the spirit , I give you orders in the name of Jesus Christ , to come out of her . And it came out that very hour .
But when her masters saw that their hope of profit was gone , they took Paul and Silas , pulling them into the market-place before the rulers ;
And when they had taken them before the authorities , they said , These men , who are Jews , are greatly troubling our town ;
Teaching rules of living which it is not right for us to have or to keep , being Romans .
And the people made an attack on them all together : and the authorities took their clothing off them , and gave orders for them to be whipped .
And when they had given them a great number of blows , they put them in prison , giving orders to the keeper of the prison to keep them safely :
And he , having such orders , put them into the inner prison with chains on their feet .
But about the middle of the night , Paul and Silas were making prayers and songs to God in the hearing of the prisoners ;
And suddenly there was an earth-shock , so that the base of the prison was moved : and all the doors came open , and everyone's chains came off .
And the keeper , coming out of his sleep , and seeing the prison doors open , took his sword and was about to put himself to death , fearing that the prisoners had got away .
But Paul said in a loud voice , Do yourself no damage , for we are all here .
And he sent for lights and came rushing in and , shaking with fear , went down on his face before Paul and Silas ,
And took them out and said , Sirs , what have I to do to get salvation ?
And they said , Have faith in the Lord Jesus , and you and your family will have salvation .
And they gave the word of the Lord to him and to all who were in his house .
And that same hour of the night , he took them , and when he had given attention to their wounds , he and all his family had baptism straight away .
And he took them into his house and gave them food , and he was full of joy , having faith in God with all his family .
But when it was day , the authorities sent the police , saying , Let these men go .
And the keeper said to Paul , The authorities have given orders to let you go : come out now , and go in peace .
But Paul said to them , They have given us who are Romans a public whipping without judging us , and have put us in prison . Will they now send us out secretly ? no , truly , let them come themselves and take us out .
And the police gave an account of these words to the authorities , and they were full of fear on hearing that they were Romans ;
Then they came and made prayers to them , requesting them , when they had taken them out , to go away from the town .
And they came out of the prison and went to the house of Lydia : and when they had seen the brothers they gave them comfort and went away .
Now when they had gone through Amphipolis and Apollonia they came to Thessalonica , where there was a Synagogue of the Jews :
And Paul , as he generally did , went in to them , and on three Sabbath days had discussions with them from the holy Writings ,
Saying to them clearly and openly that Christ had to be put to death and come back to life again ; and that this Jesus , whom , he said , I am preaching to you , is the Christ .
And some of them had faith , and were joined to Paul and Silas ; and a number of the God-fearing Greeks , and some of the chief women .
But the Jews , being moved with envy , took with them certain low persons from among the common people , and getting together a great number of people , made an outcry in the town , attacking the house of Jason with the purpose of taking them out to the people .
And when they were not able to get them , they took Jason and some of the brothers by force before the rulers of the town , crying , These men , who have made trouble all over the world have now come here ;
Whom Jason has taken into his house : and they are acting against the orders of Caesar , saying that there is another king , Jesus .
And hearing these things the people and the rulers of the town were troubled .
And having made Jason and the others give an undertaking to keep the peace , they let them go .
And the brothers straight away sent Paul and Silas away by night to Beroea : and they , when they came there , went to the Synagogue of the Jews .
Now these were more noble than the Jews of Thessalonica , for they gave serious attention to the word , searching in the holy Writings every day , to see if these things were so .
And a number of them had faith , and no small number of the Greek women of high position and of the men .
But when the Jews of Thessalonica had news that Paul was preaching the word at Beroea , they came there , troubling the people and working them up .
So the brothers sent Paul straight away to the sea : but Silas and Timothy kept there still .
But those who went with Paul took him as far as Athens , and then went away , with orders from him to Silas and Timothy to come to him quickly .
Now while Paul was waiting for them at Athens , his spirit was troubled , for he saw all the town full of images of the gods .
So he had discussions in the Synagogue with the Jews and God-fearing Gentiles , and every day in the market-place with those who were there .
And some of those who were supporters of the theories of the Epicureans and the Stoics , had a meeting with him . And some said , What is this talker of foolish words saying ? And others , He seems to be a preacher of strange gods : because he was preaching of Jesus and his coming back from the dead .
And they took him to Mars' Hill , saying , Will you make clear to us what is this new teaching of yours ?
For you seem to us to say strange things , and we have a desire to get the sense of them .
(Now all the Athenians and the men from other lands who come there were giving all their time to talking or hearing of anything new .)
And Paul got to his feet on Mars' Hill and said , O men of Athens , I see that you are overmuch given to fear of the gods .
For when I came by , I was looking at the things to which you give worship , and I saw an altar with this writing on it , TO THE GOD OF WHOM THERE IS NO KNOWLEDGE . Now , what you , without knowledge , give worship to , I make clear to you .
The God who made the earth and everything in it , he , being Lord of heaven and earth , is not housed in buildings made with hands ;
And he is not dependent on the work of men's hands , as if he had need of anything , for he himself gives to all life and breath and all things ;
And he has made of one blood all the nations of men living on all the face of the earth , ordering their times and the limits of their lands ,
So that they might make search for God , in order , if possible , to get knowledge of him and make discovery of him , though he is not far from every one of us :
For in him we have life and motion and existence ; as certain of your verse writers have said , For we are his offspring .
If then we are the offspring of God , it is not right for us to have the idea that God is like gold or silver or stone , formed by the art or design of man .
Those times when men had no knowledge were overlooked by God ; but now he gives orders to all men in every place to undergo a change of heart :
Because a day has been fixed in which all the world will be judged in righteousness by the man who has been marked out by him for this work ; of which he has given a sign to all men by giving him back from the dead .
Now on hearing about the coming back from death , some of them made sport of it , but others said , Let us go more fully into this another time .
And so Paul went away from among them .
But some men gave him their support : among whom was Dionysius the Areopagite , and a woman named Damaris , and others with them .
After these things , he went away from Athens , and came to Corinth .
And there he came across a certain Jew named Aquila , a man of Pontus by birth , who not long before had come from Italy with his wife Priscilla , because Claudius had given orders that all Jews were to go away from Rome : and he came to them ;
And because he was of the same trade , he was living with them , and they did their work together ; for by trade they were tent-makers .
And every Sabbath he had discussions in the Synagogue , turning Jews and Greeks to the faith .
And when Silas and Timothy came down from Macedonia , Paul was completely given up to the word , preaching to the Jews that the Christ was Jesus .
And when they put themselves against him , and said evil words , he said , shaking his clothing , Your blood be on your heads , I am clean : from now I will go to the Gentiles .
And moving from there , he went into the house of a man named Titus Justus , a God-fearing man , whose house was very near the Synagogue .
And Crispus , the ruler of the Synagogue , with all his family , had faith in the Lord ; and a great number of the people of Corinth , hearing the word , had faith and were given baptism .
And the Lord said to Paul in the night , in a vision , Have no fear and go on preaching :
For I am with you , and no one will make an attack on you to do you damage : for I have a number of people in this town .
And he was there for a year and six months , teaching the word of God among them .
But when Gallio was ruler of Achaia , all the Jews together made an attack on Paul , and took him to the judge's seat ,
Saying , This man is teaching the people to give worship to God in a way which is against the law .
But when Paul was about to say something , Gallio said to the Jews , If this was anything to do with wrongdoing or crime , there would be a reason for me to give you a hearing :
But if it is a question of words or names or of your law , see to it yourselves ; I will not be a judge of such things .
And he sent them away from the judge's seat .
And they all made an attack on Sosthenes , the ruler of the Synagogue , and gave him blows before the judge's seat ; but Gallio gave no attention to these things .
And Paul , after waiting some days , went away from the brothers and went by ship to Syria , Priscilla and Aquila being with him ; and he had had his hair cut off in Cenchrea , for he had taken an oath .
And they came down to Ephesus and he left them there : and he himself went into the Synagogue and had a discussion with the Jews .
And being requested by them to be there for a longer time , he said , No ;
And went from them , saying , I will come back to you if God lets me ; and he took ship from Ephesus .
And when he had come to land at Caesarea , he went to see the church , and then went down to Antioch .
And having been there for some time , he went through the country of Galatia and Phrygia in order , making the disciples strong in the faith .
Now a certain Jew named Apollos , an Alexandrian by birth , and a man of learning , came to Ephesus ; and he had great knowledge of the holy Writings .
This man had been trained in the way of the Lord ; and burning in spirit , he gave himself up to teaching the facts about Jesus , though he had knowledge only of John's baptism :
And he was preaching in the Synagogue without fear . But Priscilla and Aquila , hearing his words , took him in , and gave him fuller teaching about the way of God .
And when he had a desire to go over into Achaia , the brothers gave him help , and sent letters to the disciples requesting them to take him in among them : and when he had come , he gave much help to those who had faith through grace :
For he overcame the Jews in public discussion , making clear from the holy Writings that the Christ was Jesus .
And it came about that while Apollos was at Corinth , Paul , having gone through the higher country , came to Ephesus , where there were certain disciples :
And he said to them , Did you get the Holy Spirit when you had faith ? And they said to him , No , we have had no knowledge of the Holy Spirit .
And he said , What sort of baptism did you have ? And they said , The baptism of John .
And Paul said , John gave a baptism which goes with a change of heart , saying to the people that they were to have faith in him who was coming after him , that is , in Jesus .
And hearing this , they had baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus .
And when Paul had put his hands on them , the Holy Spirit came on them ; and they had the power of talking in tongues , and acting like prophets .
And there were about twelve of these men .
And he went into the Synagogue , and for three months he was preaching there without fear , reasoning and teaching about the kingdom of God .
But because some of the people were hard-hearted and would not give hearing , saying evil words about the Way before the people , he went away from them , and kept the disciples separate , reasoning every day in the school of Tyrannus .
And this went on for two years , so that all those who were living in Asia had knowledge of the word of the Lord , Greeks as well as Jews .
And God did special works of power by the hands of Paul :
So that bits of linen and clothing from his body were taken to people who were ill , and their diseases went away from them and the evil spirits went out .
But some of the Jews who went from place to place driving out evil spirits , took it on themselves to make use of the name of the Lord Jesus over those who had evil spirits , saying , I give you orders , by Jesus , whom Paul is preaching .
And there were seven sons of a man named Sceva , a Jew and a chief priest , who did this .
And the evil spirit , answering , said to them , I have knowledge of Jesus , and of Paul , but who are you ?
And the man in whom the evil spirit was , jumping on them , was stronger than the two of them , and overcame them , so that they went running from that house , wounded and without their clothing .
And this came to the ears of all those , Jews and Greeks , who were living at Ephesus ; and fear came on them all , and the name of the Lord Jesus was made great .
And a number of those who had faith came and made a public statement of their sins and all their acts .
And a great number of those who were experts in strange arts took their books and put them on the fire in front of everyone : and when the books were valued they came to fifty thousand bits of silver .
So the word of the Lord was increased very greatly and was full of power .
Now after these things were ended , Paul came to a decision that when he had gone through Macedonia and Achaia he would go to Jerusalem , saying , After I have been there , I have a desire to see Rome .
And having sent two of his helpers , Timothy and Erastus , into Macedonia , he himself went on living in Asia for a time .
And about that time a great outcry took place about the Way .
For there was a certain man named Demetrius , a silver-worker , who made silver boxes for the images of Diana , and gave no small profit to the workmen ;
Whom he got together , with other workmen of the same trade , and said to them , Men , it is clear that from this business we get our wealth .
And you see , for it has come to your ears , that not only at Ephesus , but almost all through Asia , this Paul has been teaching numbers of people and turning them away , saying that those are not gods who are made by men's hands :
And there is danger , not only that our trade may be damaged in the opinion of men , but that the holy place of the great goddess Diana may be no longer honoured , and that she to whom all Asia and the world give worship , will be put down from her high position .
And hearing this , they were very angry , crying out and saying , Great is Diana of Ephesus .
And the town was full of noise and trouble , and they all came running into the theatre , having taken by force Gaius and Aristarchus , men of Macedonia who were journeying in company with Paul .
And when Paul was about to go in to the people , the disciples did not let him .
And some of the rulers of Asia , being his friends , sent to him , requesting him seriously not to put himself in danger by going into the theatre .
And some said one thing , and some another : for there was no order in the meeting ; and most of them had no idea why they had come together .
Then they took Alexander out from among the people , the Jews putting him forward . And Alexander , making a sign with his hand , was about to make a statement to the people in answer :
But when they saw that he was a Jew , all of them with one voice went on crying out for about two hours , Great is Diana of Ephesus .
And when the chief secretary had got the people quiet , he said , Men of Ephesus , is any man without knowledge that the town of Ephesus is the keeper of the holy place of the great Diana , who was sent down from Jupiter ?
So then , because these things may not be doubted , it would be better for you to be quiet , and do nothing unwise .
For you have taken these men , who are not doing damage to the holy place or talking against our goddess .
If , then , Demetrius and the workmen who are with him have a protest to make against any man , the law is open to them , and there are judges ; let them put up a cause at law against one another .
But if any other business is in question , let it be taken up in the regular meeting .
For , truly , we are in danger of being made responsible for this day's trouble , there being no cause for it : and we are not able to give any reason for this coming together .
And when he had said this , he sent the meeting away .
